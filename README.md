# Using TypeScript with Angular 1.x sample app
TypeScript is the official language of Angular 2, but it is still too early to use Angular 2 in production for many reasons (the most important reason being that it is still in alpha). What if you want to use TypeScript now, right away, without having to wait for the arrival of the stable version of Angular? Well, it turns out that this is quite easy to achieve.

This repository contains sample code for the blog post **[Using TypeScript with Angular 1.x](http://blog.priceandcost.com/development/using-typescript-with-angular-1)**.

# Usage
Clone this repository, install npm dependencies and serve the application as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/priceandcost/angular-1-and-typescript-sample.git
cd angular-1-and-typescript-sample
npm install
npm start
```
